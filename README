aria2-WIOW
==========

Aria2 Web Interface Over WebSocket. All in html, css and javascript so
it counld be used in local file system or visited from a HTTP server
(only with HTTP protocol, since aria2 does not support WebSocket
Secure connection and a normal WebSocket connection in HTTPS is
insecure).

Required:

* aria2 higher than 1.15.0, build with WebSocket support, running with
  --enable-rpc=true option.

* a web browser that support JavaScript, WebSocket, FileReader and
  some HTML5/CSS3 (the more, the better).
  (view testapi.html to test the browser).

This project is mostly working now.
